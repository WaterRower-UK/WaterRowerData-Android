# WaterRowerData for Android

A library for reading data from a BLE-connected WaterRower device

## WaterRowerData-BLE

The `uk.co.waterrower:waterrowerdata-ble` artifact contains the sources for
reading data from a BLE connected WaterRower device, such as an S5 monitor.
See [waterrowerdata-ble/Readme](waterrowerdata-ble/README.md) for usage
instructions.

## Setup

// TODO

## Development

This project uses Gradle to test and build the library:

 - `./gradlew test` builds and runs the tests
 - `./gradlew :sample-app:installDebug` installs the sample application on
    a connected device.
